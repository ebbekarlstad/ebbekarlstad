### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ebbe, I'm a Software Engineering student passionate about coding and technology. I've gathered knowledge about backend and frontend development, including stuff like design in JavaFX and Database Management using MySQL.

âš¡ I have a solid understanding of Python for various smaller projects, I've also done bigger, object-oriented projects in Java and JavaFX. Apart from that, I've also learnt discrete mathematics, as well as computer security principles to protect systems and data. I'm also knowledgeable in MySQL for efficient database management.

I'm always eager to learn and work on new projects, collaborating with others to create innovative solutions. Let's connect and build something awesome together! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
