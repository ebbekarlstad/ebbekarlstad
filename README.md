### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ebbe, and Iâ€™m a Software Engineering student with a passion for coding and technology. Through my personal projects and studies, Iâ€™ve gained experience in both backend and frontend development, including designing user interfaces with JavaFX and managing databases using MySQL.

âš¡ I have hands-on experience with Python for smaller projects and have developed larger, object-oriented applications in Java and JavaFX. My studies have also provided me with a solid foundation in Discrete Mathematics, Linear Algebra, and Computer Security principles, enabling me to build secure and efficient systems. Additionally, Iâ€™m skilled in MySQL for designing and optimizing database management systems.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn, take on new challenges, and collaborate with others to create exciting projects. Letâ€™s connect and build something awesome together! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
