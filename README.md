### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ebbe, and Iâ€™m a Software Engineering student with a passion for coding and technology. Through my personal projects and studies, Iâ€™ve gained experience in both backend and frontend development, including designing user interfaces with JavaFX and managing databases using MySQL.

âš¡ I have hands-on experience with Python for smaller projects, and I have developed larger, object-oriented applications in Java and JavaFX. These have been done using industry-standard systems like Git and SCRUM. I also have a solid foundation in different fields of Mathematics, Computer Security, and Database Management.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn, take on new challenges, and collaborate with others to create exciting projects. Letâ€™s connect and build something awesome together! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
