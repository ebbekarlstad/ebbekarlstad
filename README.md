### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ebbe, I'm a Software Engineering student passionate about coding and all things technology! Throughout my personal projects and my Bachelors Degree, I've gathered knowledge about backend and frontend development, including stuff like design in JavaFX and Database Management using MySQL.

âš¡ I have a basic understanding of Python for various smaller projects, I've also done bigger, object-oriented projects in Java and JavaFX. Apart from that, I've also learnt Discrete Mathematics and Linear Algebra, as well as Computer Security principles to protect systems and data. I'm also knowledgeable in MySQL for building efficient DBMS's.

I'm always eager to learn and work on new projects, collaborating with others to create cool projects. Let's connect and build something awesome together! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
